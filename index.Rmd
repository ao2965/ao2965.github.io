## Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!🌸

I am Alissa Shams Orchi, a graduate student in Epidemiology with a strong interest in maternal and child health. This site serves as both a portfolio of my academic and research projects.


Learn about my experience [here](resume.html).


And if you see a certain gray cat below, that’s Dusky, who reminds me to be resilient and at the same time priorotize my sleep. 🐱

Thanks for visiting.
